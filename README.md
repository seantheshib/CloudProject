## Project Overview

CloudGraph is a full-stack cloud application with two main parts:

- **FrontEnd** — a React/Vite app that renders photos as an interactive force-directed graph with dynamic clustering, smooth animations, and a dark cinematic aesthetic inspired by Obsidian's graph view.
- **BackEnd** — a FastAPI server backed by AWS (S3, Lambda, Cognito, RDS PostgreSQL) that handles authenticated uploads, EXIF extraction, thumbnail generation, graph relationship building, and DBSCAN clustering.

---

## Frontend

### Features
- Force-directed graph with physics-based node simulation
- Dynamic clustering — switch between Location, Timeline, and People filters
- Hover interactions — tooltips reveal photo metadata and highlight connections
- Smooth animations when switching cluster modes
- Canvas rendering for 120+ nodes at 60fps
- Dark, cinematic aesthetic

### Getting Started

**AWS services used:** S3, SNS, SQS, Lambda, Cognito, RDS (PostgreSQL)

---

### API Endpoints

#### `GET /health`
Simple liveness check.
```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

---

#### `POST /api/upload`
Upload a single photo. The file is stored in S3 under `uploads/{user_id}/{uuid}.ext`. Lambda functions automatically handle EXIF extraction and thumbnail generation in the background via the SQS queue.

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <cognito_token>`
**Body:** `multipart/form-data` — `file` field (JPEG, PNG, or HEIC)

```json
{
  "file_key": "uploads/user-sub/uuid.jpg",
  "presigned_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/...",
  "message": "Upload successful. Background processing initiated."
}
```
The `presigned_url` is valid for **15 minutes**.

---

#### `POST /api/upload/batch-presign`
Generate presigned S3 PUT URLs for a batch of up to 500 files. The client uploads directly to S3 in parallel — no file data passes through the API server. See [bulkUpload.js](#bulk-upload) for the frontend utility.

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <cognito_token>`
**Body:** `application/json`

```json
{ "files": [{ "filename": "photo1.jpg", "content_type": "image/jpeg" }] }
```

```json
{
  "uploads": [
    { "filename": "photo1.jpg", "file_key": "uploads/.../uuid.jpg", "presigned_url": "https://..." }
  ]
}
```
Each presigned URL is scoped to exactly `uploads/{user_id}/{uuid}.ext` with a **15-minute TTL**.

---

#### `GET /api/graph`
Returns a graph of relationships between the user's photos based on time and geographic proximity. Designed to feed directly into D3.js or Cytoscape.

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <cognito_token>`

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `time_threshold_minutes` | `60` | Max time gap (minutes) to create a time edge |
| `distance_threshold_km` | `1.0` | Max distance (km) to create a location edge |

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "uploads/user/uuid.jpg", "date_taken": "2023-10-12T14:30:00", "gps_lat": 48.8566, "gps_lon": 2.3522 }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "source": "uploads/user/uuid1.jpg", "target": "uploads/user/uuid2.jpg", "relationship": "time+location" }
  ]
}
```
Edge `relationship` values: `"time"`, `"location"`, or `"time+location"`.

---

#### `GET /api/clusters`
Groups the user's photos into clusters using a pure Python DBSCAN implementation. Clusters are labelled with a human-readable date and city name (e.g. `2023-10-12 · Paris`) via Nominatim geocoding.

For larger libraries, clustering is offloaded to an async Lambda and the result is cached in the database. Requests within 10 minutes of a completed run return the cached result instantly.

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <cognito_token>`

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | `"combined"` | `"time"`, `"location"`, or `"combined"` |
| `time_eps_minutes` | `60` | DBSCAN epsilon for time axis (minutes) |
| `distance_eps_km` | `1.0` | DBSCAN epsilon for location axis (km) |
| `min_samples` | `2` | Minimum photos to form a cluster |

```json
{
  "clusters": [
    {
      "cluster_id": "uuid",
      "label": "2023-10-12 · Paris",
      "photo_ids": ["uploads/user/uuid1.jpg", "uploads/user/uuid2.jpg"],
      "centroid_lat": 48.8566,
      "centroid_lon": 2.3522
    }
  ],
  "unclustered": ["uploads/user/uuid3.jpg"]
}
```

---

### Database Schema

Tables are created by running `python BackEnd/scripts/setup_database.py` once.

#### `image_metadata`

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `image_id` | VARCHAR (PK) | S3 object key |
| `user_id` | VARCHAR | Cognito user `sub` |
| `uploaded_at` | VARCHAR | ISO 8601 upload timestamp |
| `date_taken` | VARCHAR (nullable) | ISO 8601 date from EXIF |
| `gps_lat` | FLOAT (nullable) | Latitude from EXIF GPS |
| `gps_lon` | FLOAT (nullable) | Longitude from EXIF GPS |
| `thumbnail_key` | VARCHAR (nullable) | S3 key of the generated thumbnail |
| `status` | VARCHAR | Processing state: `pending` → `processed` |

#### `cluster_results`

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | INTEGER (PK) | Auto-incrementing ID |
| `user_id` | VARCHAR | Cognito user `sub` |
| `computed_at` | VARCHAR | ISO 8601 timestamp of when clustering ran |
| `mode` | VARCHAR | Clustering mode used |
| `result` | TEXT | Full cluster result serialised as JSON |

---

### Authentication

All endpoints (except `/health`) require a Cognito JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The `get_current_user` dependency validates the token by fetching the JWKS from Cognito's `.well-known` endpoint, verifying the RS256 signature, and returning the user's `sub` as their unique ID. Both `id` tokens and `access` tokens are supported.

---

### Lambda Functions

| Function | Trigger | Responsibility |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `image_processor.py` | `s3:ObjectCreated:*` on `uploads/` | Extracts EXIF date + GPS and writes to `image_metadata` |
| `thumbnail_generator.py` | `s3:ObjectCreated:*` on `uploads/` | Generates a 300×300 JPEG thumbnail, uploads to `thumbnails/`, updates `thumbnail_key` |
| `clustering_processor.py` | Async Lambda invocation from `/api/clusters` | Runs DBSCAN and saves result to `cluster_results` |

## Full AWS Deployment Guide

### Phase 1: Security & Infrastructure

#### 1. Amazon Cognito (Authentication)
1. Open the **AWS Cognito Console** → **Create user pool**
2. Select **Email** as the sign-in attribute
3. In the **App Integration** step, create a **Public client** (no client secret)
4. Note down your **User Pool ID** and **App Client ID**

#### 2. Amazon S3 (Photo Storage)
1. Open the **AWS S3 Console** → **Create bucket**
2. Name it uniquely (e.g. `cloudgraph-uploads-xyz`)
3. Leave Block Public Access **ON** — the backend generates presigned URLs, so the bucket does not need to be public
4. Enable **CORS** in the bucket permissions to allow your frontend domain to read files

#### 3. Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL Database)
1. Open the **AWS RDS Console** → **Create database**
2. Select **PostgreSQL** as the engine (or **Aurora PostgreSQL** for production)
3. Choose a `db.t3.micro` instance for development
4. Note down your **endpoint**, **port**, **username**, and **password**
5. Make sure its **Security Group** allows inbound connections on port `5432` from **both** your ECS task security group AND your local computer's IP address (so you can run the table creation script locally).

#### 4. Amazon SNS & SQS (Upload Buffering)
1. Open the **AWS SNS Console** → **Create topic** (Standard). Name it `cloudgraph-uploads-topic`.
2. Open the **AWS SQS Console** → **Create queue**. Name it `cloudgraph-image-processing-dlq`.
3. Create another queue named `cloudgraph-image-processing` (Visibility timeout: 300s). For the **Redrive policy**, select your DLQ and set Maximum receives to 3.
4. Subscribe the `cloudgraph-image-processing` queue to the `cloudgraph-uploads-topic` SNS topic.
5. In the **AWS S3 Console**, go to your bucket → **Properties** → **Event notifications**. Create an event for `s3:ObjectCreated:*` with prefix `uploads/` and select your SNS topic as the destination.

---

### Phase 2: Backend & Lambdas (EC2 Auto Scaling)

#### 1. Serverless Lambda Workers
1. Create **3 empty Lambda functions** in the AWS Console: `thumbnail_generator`, `image_processor`, and `clustering_processor`. Choose **Python 3.10+**.
2. **Execution Role:** If you are on a Student Account (AWS Academy/Vocareum), select the existing **`LabRole`**. Do NOT try to create a new role, as your permissions are likely restricted.
3. In the AWS Lambda Console for each function, click **Upload from > .zip file**. Use the files in `BackEnd/deploy_zips/`.
4. On the function pages for `image_processor` and `thumbnail_generator`, click **Add trigger** → select **SQS**, point it to `cloudgraph-image-processing`.
5. Set **Reserved concurrency** on `clustering_processor` to **10**.

#### 2. FastAPI Core Server (EC2 Auto Scaling Group)

1. **IAM Role:** If you are on a Student Account, select the existing **`LabRole`** (or `LabInstanceProfile`) when configuring the Launch Template. This role already has the necessary permissions for S3, RDS, and CloudWatch.
2. **Target Group:** Create a Target Group (Type: Instance, Port: 8000). Set the health check path to `/health`.
3. **Load Balancer:** Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and add a listener on port 80 (or 443) that forwards to your Target Group.
4. **Launch Template:** Create a Launch Template for your EC2 instances:
   - **AMI:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
   - **Instance Type:** `t3.micro` or similar.
   - **User Data:** Paste the contents of `BackEnd/scripts/setup_ec2.sh`. Update the placeholders (`REPO_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc.) with your actual values.
5. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG):** Create an ASG using your Launch Template:
   - Select your VPC and subnets.
   - Attach it to the existing Load Balancer / Target Group.
   - Set **Desired capacity** to 1, **Minimum** to 1, and **Maximum** to 10.
6. **Scaling Policy:** In the ASG **Automatic scaling** tab, add a **Target tracking scaling policy**:
   - **Metric type:** Average CPU utilization.
   - **Target value:** 60.
   - **Instances need:** 300 seconds to warm up.

#### 3. Database Migration

**Good news!** The API now includes **auto-migration logic**. As soon as your first EC2 instance starts up and connects to the RDS database, it will automatically create the necessary `image_metadata` and `cluster_results` tables for you.

You do **not** need to run any scripts locally if you cannot connect to the database from your computer. Just ensure your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is correct in your Launch Template's User Data.

---

## Security Architecture

The application uses **Amazon Cognito** for authentication. All API calls (except `/health`) require a valid JWT token.

- **Authentication:** Verified via Cognito's JWKS endpoint.
- **Data Isolation:** Enforced at the application level by filtering all database queries by the authenticated `user_id`.
- **S3 Access:** Secured via 15-minute **Presigned URLs**. The API ensures that users can only get or put objects within their own `uploads/{user_id}/` folder.

---

## Bulk Upload Made Easy

CloudGraph handles batches of up to **500 images** at once using a high-performance "direct-to-S3" strategy. This means your images bypass the API server, preventing bottlenecks and timeouts.

### How to use Bulk Upload:

1.  **Select Files:** In the frontend UI, select multiple images (JPEG, PNG, or HEIC).
2.  **Get Permission:** The frontend calls `POST /api/upload/batch-presign` with the list of filenames. The backend returns a set of unique, short-lived S3 upload URLs.
3.  **Parallel Upload:** The frontend utility (`bulkUpload.js`) automatically uploads your files directly to S3 in parallel batches.
4.  **Background Processing:** As soon as an image hits S3, AWS SQS triggers the **Image Processor** (for EXIF extraction) and **Thumbnail Generator** (for 300x300 previews).
5.  **Done!** Your graph will update automatically as processing finishes.

> [!TIP]
> The bulk upload utility uses `Promise.allSettled`, so if one file fails during a massive batch, the rest will continue successfully.

---

### Phase 3: React Frontend (AWS Amplify)

#### 1. Update the API Base URL
In `FrontEnd/src/api.js`, point the app at your live EC2 backend:
```javascript
export const API_BASE = 'https://YOUR-ALB-DNS-NAME/api';
```

#### 2. Deploy to AWS Amplify
1. Push your updated code to GitHub
2. Open the **AWS Amplify Console** → **Host Web App**
3. Connect your GitHub repository and select your branch
4. Amplify auto-detects Vite and uses `npm run build` to compile the static assets
5. Click **Save and Deploy**

Amplify will provide a live URL (e.g. `https://main.xyz.amplifyapp.com`). Navigate there, authenticate with a Cognito token, and your photos will upload, trigger the Lambda processors, and render to the D3 graph entirely in the cloud.

## 📚 API Guide Notebook
An interactive `BackEnd/api_guide.ipynb` Jupyter notebook is included for testing and debugging all endpoints locally using Python HTTP calls.

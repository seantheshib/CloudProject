# CloudGraph: Full AWS Deployment Guide

This guide covers how to deploy the entire CloudGraph application—both the React frontend and the FastAPI backend—completely to AWS for a production-ready environment.

---

## Phase 1: Security & Database Provisioning

### 1. Amazon Cognito (Authentication)
Before anything else, you need a Cognito User Pool to generate the JWT tokens that lock down your graph API.
1. Go to the **AWS Cognito Console** and click **Create user pool**.
2. Select **Email** as the sign-in attribute.
3. Configure password requirements as desired.
4. Skip MFA for development, or require it for production.
5. In the **App Integration** step, create a **Public client** (do not generate a client secret). 
6. Create the pool. Note down your **User Pool ID** and **Client ID**.

### 2. Amazon S3 (Photo Storage)
1. Go to the **AWS S3 Console** and click **Create bucket**.
2. Name it uniquely (e.g., `cloudgraph-uploads-xyz`). 
3. Leave Block Public Access **ON**—the backend generates secure pre-signed URLs, so the bucket itself does not need to be public.
4. Enable **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in the bucket permissions to allow your frontend URL to read/put files.

### 3. DynamoDB (Metadata & Caching)
Run our automated script from your local `BackEnd` folder to instantly provision the `ImageMetadata` and `ClusterResults` tables (natively supporting AWS Academy Query constraints via Composite Keys):
```bash
cd BackEnd
python scripts/create_dynamo_table.py
python scripts/setup_lambda_triggers.py
```

## Phase 2: Deploying the Backend API & Lambdas

Your `BackEnd` directory contains two architectures: the live FastAPI endpoints and the asynchronous AWS Lambda workers.

### 1. Serverless Lambda Workers
Our background processors (thumbnails and EXIF extraction) natively run on Lambda to keep your UI lightning fast, while the heavy Machine Learning clustering runs synchronously on the EC2 server to bypass the 250MB AWS Lambda size limit.
1. **Create 2 empty Lambda functions** in the AWS Console matching exactly these names: `thumbnail_generator` and `image_processor`. Choose **Python 3.10+** as the runtime.
2. Give their IAM Execution Roles permission to read/write to S3 and DynamoDB.
3. Deploy the code from your local machine using our smart script (which automatically zips lightweight dependencies and uploads via S3):
```bash
cd BackEnd
chmod +x scripts/deploy_lambda.sh
bash scripts/deploy_lambda.sh
```
4. **Update the AWS Handlers**: Go into the "Runtime settings" for both Lambdas in the AWS Console and change the **Handler** to `image_processor.lambda_handler` and `thumbnail_generator.lambda_handler` respectively.
5. **Wire the SNS Topic Hub Triggers**: Go to your S3 Bucket properties -> **Event Notifications**. Create a new event for `s3:ObjectCreated:*` with the prefix `uploads/`, and select an **Amazon SNS Topic** as the destination. Then, go to the Amazon SNS Console and Subscribe both of your Lambdas to that exact topic!

### 2. FastAPI Core Server (Amazon EC2)
The main API Server (which serves `/upload`, `/graph`, `/clusters`) needs to be hosted 24/7. **Amazon EC2** is the best option for AWS Academy environments.
1. Go to the AWS EC2 Console and launch a new **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** instance (t2.micro is fine).
2. Under **Network settings**, choose "Select existing security group" or create a new one. Add an **Inbound Rule** for `Custom TCP`, Port Range `8000`, Source `Anywhere-IPv4`.
3. SSH into your instance using EC2 Instance Connect or your `.pem` key.
4. Run the following commands to install dependencies and pull your code:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3-pip git -y
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/CloudProject.git
cd CloudProject/BackEnd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Create your environment file:
```bash
nano .env
```
Paste your production variables into it (AWS keys, Academy session token, Cognito IDs) and save (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`).
6. Run the server permanently in the background using `nohup`:
```bash
nohup uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
```
7. Note down your EC2 instance's **Public IPv4 address**. Your API is now live at `http://YOUR-EC2-IP:8000/api`.

## Phase 3: Deploying the React Frontend

Now that your backend URL is live, it's time to host the web interface. **AWS Amplify** is the recommended standard for hosting React/Vite apps.

### 1. Update API References
In your `FrontEnd/src/api.js` file, change the `API_BASE` from localhost to your new live backend URL:
```javascript
// Change this:
// export const API_BASE = 'http://localhost:8000/api';

// To your live AWS App Runner / Backend URL:
export const API_BASE = 'https://YOUR-APP-RUNNER-URL.awsapprunner.com/api';
```

### 2. Connect to AWS Amplify
1. Push your updated `FrontEnd/` folder to GitHub.
2. Open the **AWS Amplify Console** and click **Host Web App**.
3. Connect your GitHub repository and select your branch.
4. Amplify will automatically detect that it's a Vite project. It will use `npm run build` to compile the static assets.
5. Click **Save and Deploy**.

### 3. Final Integration Test
Amplify will provide you with a live frontend URL (e.g., `https://main.xyz.amplifyapp.com`). 
Navigate to that URL, paste a generated Cognito token into your new Data Panel, and watch your photos upload, trigger the asynchronous AWS Lambdas, and render to the D3 graph entirely in the cloud!
